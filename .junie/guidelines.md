### SolidJS HTML Elements
- When generating HTML elements, always use the `class` attribute instead of React's `className`. SolidJS follows standard HTML attribute naming for classes.
- Ensure all components follow the SolidJS naming convention.
- Ensure component compliance with SolidJS best practices.

### SolidStart & Routing
- Use the `<A>` component from `@solidjs/router` for all internal links to ensure proper SPA navigation and prevent full page reloads.
- Page components and routes should be wrapped in `Suspense` and `ErrorBoundary` to handle loading states and catch runtime errors.
- Do not hardcode the `url` prop in the `Router` component in `app.jsx` unless specifically required for SSR state, as it can cause unexpected redirects on page reload.
- When loading dynamic content (e.g., Markdown files via `import.meta.glob`) based on route parameters, use robust and case-insensitive matching logic to ensure compatibility across different environments.
- Use directory-based parameterized routing (e.g., `src/routes/changelog/[item].jsx`) for cleaner route structure and to ensure reliable parameter resolution.
- Always implement loading fallbacks and explicit "not found" or error states for dynamic routes.

### Styling
- This project is styled using SCSS.
- Any modifications to the stylesheets must be done using the SCSS syntax.
- Any colors used must be formatted using hsl.
- If a provided color is not hsl, it must be converted to hsl.
- Use the `!important` rule sparingly and only when necessary.
- Use `em` and `rem` units for element sizing.
- Use `pt` units for typography.
- Use `px` for @media queries.
- Ensure SCSS files are formatted with proper indentation and adhere to the SCSS style guide.

### Ignore Files
- Unless directly referenced in the request, ignore any files in `.hidden`.

### Compressing Files
- Unless otherwise noted, use 7zip to compress files using the installed binary.
- Compress all files into the 7z format.
- Unless otherwise noted, place all compressed files in the `.compressed` folder.
- If developing on Linux, use `tar` to compress files instead of 7zip.
- If developing on Linux, compress into the `.tar.gz` format instead of the `.7z` format.

### File Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive and consistent naming conventions for files and folders.
- Avoid using spaces or special characters in file and folder names.
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens for file and folder names.
- All imports must strictly match the filename casing. Since filenames are lowercase, imports should also be lowercase.

### Running System Commands
- If multiple commands are required to run, use a script or batch file to automate the process.
- Ensure that all commands are tested and working correctly before including them in the guidelines.

### Path handling
- Always use forward slashes `/` for path handling.
- When referencing to another component, use the relative path from the source root.
- Use the `src` directory as the root for all relative paths.
- When referencing an Image, use absolute paths.
- When using the word `root` in a path, use the `src` directory as the root. Only refer to root as the Linux root directory when explicitly asked.

### Helper Scripts
- If a `utils` folder exists, use it to store helper scripts that automate processes or generate files.
- Ensure that all scripts are tested and working correctly before including them in the guidelines.
