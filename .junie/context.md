### Core Architecture
- **Framework**: SolidStart (SolidJS-based Meta-framework).
- **Styling**: SCSS (Standardized to use HSL for colors, `rem`/`em` for sizing and typography).
- **Routing**: File-based routing in `src/routes`.
- **Data Handling**: Dynamic JSON manifests for data-driven components.

### AI Agent Interaction
- Always reference the `.junie/context.md` and `.junie/project.md` files at the beginning of a session to ensure alignment with the project's current state and architectural decisions.
### Logging & Summaries
- Maintain logs of all chat sessions in the `.logs/` folder. Log files are organized by date (e.g., `chat-session-YYYY-MM-DD.log`). Append all entries for the same day to that day's log file.
- When explicitly requested to provide a "context summary" or "summary of the day/session", create a separate file in the `.logs/` folder named `summary_YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `summary_2026-02-10.md`) containing the summarized highlights.
- When adding new rules or details to the documentation in `.junie/`, ensure they are placed within their respective sections (e.g., technical rules in `guidelines.md`, project-specific data in `project.md`, and architectural/workflow context in `context.md`) to maintain organization and reduce the need for future refactoring.
- **Guideline Sync**: When updating internal guidelines (`.junie/guidelines.md`) with new rules applicable to development style, structure, or coding standards, ensure that the public-facing `CONTRIBUTING.md` is also updated to reflect these changes.

### Development Workflow
- **Logging**: Every chat session MUST be logged in `.logs/`, unless the user explicitly starts a request with "No Log". In that case, do not log the session, do not commit the associated changes, and do not mention the omission in the response. This instruction applies globally to the current project and all sibling projects (`$PROJECT_NAME/`) affected by the session.
- **Commits**: Upon successful completion of a task, automatically commit the changes to Git. Keep commit messages brief (at most 2 full sentences) and only divulge necessary information about the changes.
- **Python Style**: PEP 8 (autopep8), minimal nesting (<= 4 indents), standard library preference.
- **Resource Management**: Download fonts and images locally (e.g., `public/fonts`) instead of using CDNs to ensure reliability and offline availability.
